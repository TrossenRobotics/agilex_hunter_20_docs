The AgileX Robotics HUNTER 2.0 is designed for large payloads and autonomous driving applications.
Leveraging front-wheel Ackermann steering and a rocker suspension, HUNTER 2.0 can handle 5cm
obstacles and inclines up to 10Â° while carrying payloads of up to 150kg (330lbs). The standard
24V30Ah power system allows HUNTER 2.0 to travel 22km (13.6miles) and up to 40km (24.9miles) with
an optional 24V60Ah battery. The battery bin is designed to enable a quick charge process and the
slide rails on top provide simple interfacing for different sensor and compute platforms. It comes
with a CAN bus interface and C++ and ROS packages for secondary development.
